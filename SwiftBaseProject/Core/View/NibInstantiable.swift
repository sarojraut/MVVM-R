/**
 UIView subclass that can be used to compose views using xibs.

 The main goal is to be able to avoid the issues that come when
 using custom views that are made in isolated xibs inside other xibs.
 This class handles all the necessary things to get you up and running
 with a view that instantiates itself propperly, wiring up all IBOutlets
 and actions automatically.

 # Usage:
 - Create your NibInstantiableView subclass as you always do with any custom view.
 - **IMPORTANT** set your xib'x FileOwner to that swift file.
 - Now you can go to another xib(or storyboard), throw a plain UIView inside and set it's class to
 your new custom view, it will inject the corresponding xib as if it wasn't created separately.

   you are going to instantiate it from another source.

   have its FILE OWNER set to be the file of the corresponding class
